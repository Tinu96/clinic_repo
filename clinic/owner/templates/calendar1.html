          '<b> 1 Peter 1:3-4, 13, 15-16 </b><br>' +
          'Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you,...Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober in spirit, fix your hope completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ...but like the Holy One who called you, be holy yourselves also in all your behavior; because it is written, “YOU SHALL BE HOLY, FOR I AM HOLY.” <br>' +
          '<b>1 Peter 1:15,14 </b> <br>' +
          'But just as he who called you is holy, so be holy in all you do;..As obedient children, do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.<br>'+
          '<b>Ephesians 4:21,24</b><br>'+
          'if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him, just as truth is in Jesus, that, in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which is being corrupted in accordance with the lusts of deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on the new self, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. <br>' +
          '<b> Job 11:13-18</b> <br>' + '<i> * God is speaking *</i>' +
          'If you would direct your heart right And spread out your hand to Him,..If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents. Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without moral defect, And you would be steadfast and not fear.For you would forget your trouble, As waters that have passed by, you would remember it. Your life would be brighter than noonday; Darkness would be like the morning. Then you would trust, because there is hope; And you would look around and rest securely. <br>' +
          '<b>Psalms 37:3-6 </b> <br>' +
          'Trust in the LORD and do good; Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness. Delight yourself in the LORD; And He will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your way to the LORD, Trust also in Him, and He will do it. He will bring forth your righteousness as the light And your judgment as the noonday. <br>' +
          '<b>Jeremiah 17:7</b><br>' +
          'But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him.<br>'+
          '<b>Job 8:11-14</b><br>' +
          '“Can the papyrus grow up without a marsh? Can the rushes grow without water? While it is still green and not cut down, Yet it withers before any other plant. So are the paths of all who forget God; And the hope of the godless will perish, Whose confidence is fragile, And whose trust a spider’s web.<br>' +
          '<b>Lamentations 3:1-6 , 15-16</b></br>' + '<i>* Referring to God *</i>' +
          'I am the man who has seen affliction Because of the rod of His wrath. He has driven me and made me walk In darkness and not in light. Surely against me He has turned His hand Repeatedly all the day. He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away, He has broken my bones. He has besieged and encompassed me with bitterness and hardship. In dark places He has made me dwell, Like those who have long been dead. He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with wormwood. He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has made me cower in the dust.',
